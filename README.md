# One Tap S.O.S

Hello,
We have made an android application that was developed using kotlin and has the sole purpose of sending people a default SOS message along with the location of the user or it can also be predefined by the user. The user has to enter phone numbers when they install the application which can be updated if they want. The next time whenever the user is in distress they can open the app and simply tap on the “send” button to alert the specified contacts. The UI is very simple and anyone can easily use the application

# Features
* SoS widget on your home screen
* Custom Message
* Selecting Emergency Contacts
* Sending current or last known location along with the message
